# delete [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/delete.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/delete)  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jonschlinkert/delete.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/jonschlinkert/delete) 

> Delete files and folders and any intermediate directories if they exist (sync and async).

Also see
* [del](https://github.com/sindresorhus/del) if you need globbing. This lib was inspired by **del**, I wanted a quick solution that prevented accidental deletion of files outside the current working directory, but for individual files and without the extra dependencies.
* [write](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/write) for writing files to disk.

## Install with [npm](npmjs.org)

```bash
npm i delete --save
```

## Usage

```js
var del = require('delete');

// delete files asynchronously
del('tmp/foo.md', function(err) {
  if (err) {throw err;}
});

// delete files synchronously
del.sync('tmp/foo.md');
```

### options.force

An error is thrown if you try to delete files outside of the current working directory (cwd).

Override the default behavior:

```js
del.sync('../foo.md', {force: true});
```
